    "Physiology will play a crucial role in determining the feasibility and accuracy of the measurements and specifications for the mentioned customer needs. For instance, when it comes to the accuracy of locating a bus stop in images, understanding human vision and perception will be essential. Ultimately, a solution that instead complements the customers sense of hearing would be optimal. I envision glasses/headphones that have cameras, and will communicate the direction and distance to a bus stop using a loud low-pitch rumbling noise. As the cameras detect the bus stop is further, the volume is lower, and as you approach, the volume increases. To communicate direction, we would use spatial audio capabilities that would make the sound come from one side or the other depending on the direction of the bus stop. The device's ability to process and analyze data in real-time should consider human cognitive and attentional capacities. For instance, the frequency of updates and the amount of information presented should be optimized to avoid overwhelming the user and ensure easy comprehension of the data. This is why the low-bass noise would be optimal "
