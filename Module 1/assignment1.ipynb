This customer interests me because I feel there are many solutions to this problem that involve computer vision. For example, we could use object detection to detect not only busses and bus stops, but also other obstacles including people, animals, and cars. By leveraging computer vision technology, we can empower individuals with visual impairments to confidently utilize public transportation, fostering independence and inclusivity in their daily lives."
